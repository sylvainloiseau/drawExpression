\title{
   Draw a graphical representation of the evaluation of an R expression.
}
\description{
  Draw a graphical representation of the steps of the evaluation of an R
  expression. Each line in the graphic represent a step in the resolution of
  the expression. Following the syntax tree, each function is resolved starting
  with the inner most. Common R object (vector, matrix, list) and mode
  (numeric, character, logical) are distinguished thanks graphical conventions.
  This representation is intented to represent the abstract syntax for
  pedagogical purposes.

\arguments{
  \item{expr}{
   An R expression to be drawn; must not contain affectation.

}
  \item{draw.names}{
   Should names (if any) be drawn on the margin of graphics?
}
  \item{filename}{
  The name of a PDF file where the plot will be saved
